# Flowchart for the automatic extraction, transcription and translation of a Youtube channel using Python and Artificial Intelligence.

I keep learning and progressing. These last weeks I have had the honour of collaborating with Vladimir SÃ¡nchez Gonzaga, CEO of #BreakingVlad (https://breakingvlad.com/) with more than 350.000 subscribers on #Youtube, for the expansion of his educational project in English.

Digging into the field of automation and AI, I have written a couple of scripts in Python that allow the extraction of all the links from his published videos by #webscraping with **selenium**, extract the audio with **pytube** and use the new AI **Whisper** for transcription and translation of the audios. The text is then read by **Polly**, an **AWS** service. The final file is an English translation of the original audio with an almost natural tone.

In the following video you can see an example of how it would look like. Thank you very much Vladimir for the opportunity.
